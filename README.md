After input the user would have access to a recurring menu. That mean gives the user an option to access the list of food trucks,

the concept of toString(), object arrays and most of all patience.

Technologies Used:
-Eclipse -Java -Terminal Commands -GitHub/Git - Zoom - Slack

Lessons Learned:
I was really tested in my understand of static fields. 
I learned that your main method typically shouldn't be longer than 2 lines of code.
I challenged myself to really use methods instead of stacking all the code in the main method.
This homework was challenging and that is exciting.
